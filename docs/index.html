      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <h3>The System Descriptor</h3>
      <p>
        Jellyfish contains the System Descriptor (SD) language that is an Architecture-as-Code
        construct modeled after the DevOps Infrastructure-as-Code paradigm that streamlines the
        flow from Development to Operations. The System Descriptor streamlines the flow from
        System Engineering to Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The System Descriptor is a collection of machine and human readable plain-text files that will enable new
        constructs for maintaining vertical (i.e., its top-down structure) and horizontal (i.e., how components interact
        with one another) traceability, quality assessment of architecture and design, and automation system acceptance
        tests. This is all to increase predictability and reduce risk within small-batch Agile program execution
        environments.
      </p>

      <h3>The Command Line Interface</h3>
      <p>
        Jellyfish is also the name of the modular command line interface (CLI) that can parse a System Descriptor model
        and produce artifacts from it. The CLI has an extensible command library that currently contains commands that
        can verify syntax and patterns, generate code and produce static reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire Jellyfish product is extensible so you can use only the features you want.
      </p>

      <h2>Why did we create it?</h2>
      <p>
        The SD language builds upon the concept of Infrastructure-as-Code with the idea to create an
        "Architecture-as-Code" approach to system engineering and modeling. By utilizing this "Architecture-as-Code"
        technique, the <a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/">flow</a>
        from systems engineering to development can likewise be improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SD model describes how the system is to be decomposed, the responsibility of the system, how the system will
        be tested, and how the system is deployed. This makes it possible to create another type of pipeline from system
        engineering to development. This pipeline can only be possible if there exists some model that describes the
        design of the system. The System Descriptor model is therefore the source artifact from which numerous other
        types of artifacts can be created. These artifacts can be generated using the Jellyfish CLI and evaluated as
        part of a pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, we wanted to have an architectural tool that can be:
        <ul>
          <li>Fully configuration managed (including version controlled)</li>
          <li>Used to provide a fail-fast approach to System Engineering</li>
          <li>Used to faciliate rapid innovation and experimentation</li>
          <li>Used to increase flow from Systems Engineering and Development</li>
          <li>Used to faciliate and drive down-stream engineering</li>
          <li>Used to provide traceablity between the architecture and what was actually built</li>
          <li>Evaluated as a part of a continuous delivery pipeline</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
