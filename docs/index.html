      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <h3>The System Descriptor</h3>
      <p>
        Jellyfish contains the System Descriptor (SD) language that is a Architecture-as-Code
        construct modeled after the DevOps Infrastructure-as-Code paradigm that streamlines
        flow from Development to Operations. The System Descriptor streamlines flow from
        System Engineering to Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The System Descriptor is a collection of machine and human readable plain-text files that will enable new
        constructs for maintaining vertical (i.e., its top-down structure) and horizontal (i.e., how components interact
        with one another) traceability, architecture and design quality assessment, and automation of system acceptance
        test. This is all to increase predictability and reduce risk within a small-batch Agile program execution
        environments.
      </p>

      <h3>The Command Line Interface</h3>
      <p>
        Jellyfish is also the name of the modular command line interface (CLI) that can parse a System Descriptor model
        and produce artifacts from it. The CLI has an extensible command library that currently contains commands that
        can verify syntax and patterns, generate code and produce static reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire Jellyfish product is extensible so you can only use the features you want.
      </p>

      <h2>Why did we create it?</h2>
      <p>
        The SD language builds upon the concept of Infrastructure-as-Code with the idea to create an
        "Architecture-as-Code" approach to system engineering and modeling. By utilizing this "Architecture-as-Code"
        technique, the <a href="">flow</a> from systems engineering to development can likewise be improved.
