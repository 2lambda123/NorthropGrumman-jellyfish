Jellyfish is a set of tools that can be used with System Descriptor projects. Jellyfish provides
software developers with a way to extend the System Descriptor language, programmatically inspect System Descriptor (SD)
projects, and to generate various custom artifacts from a project. The most notable feature that Jellyfish provides is
automatic code generation.
