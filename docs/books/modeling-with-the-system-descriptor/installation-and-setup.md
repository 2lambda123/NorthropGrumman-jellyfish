1. the base Eclipse installation for either [Linux]({{ site.eclipse_linux_download_link }}) or [Windows]({{ site.eclipse_windows_download_link }})
1. the [System Descriptor language update site]({{ safebase }}/index.html#get-jellyfish)

Note that the latest versions can be located on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.ms.northgrum.com/CEACIDE/jellyfish/releases).

1. Expand the item labeled `com/ngc/mysdproject` 
1. Double click `MyModel.sd` to open the example model

Its contents should look something similar to this:

**MyModel.sd**
```sd
package com.ngc.mysdproject
 
model MyModel {
  metadata {

    "description" : "MyModel description",
    "stereotypes" : ["model", "example"]
  }
