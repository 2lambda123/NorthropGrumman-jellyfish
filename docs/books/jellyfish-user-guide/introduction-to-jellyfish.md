Jellyfish is a set of tools that can be used with System Descriptor projects.  Jellyfish provides software developers
with a way to extend the System Descriptor language, programmatically inspect System Descriptor (SD) projects, and to
generate various custom artifacts from a project.  The most notable feature that Jellyfish provides is automatic code
generation.

It should be noted that Jellyfish does not aim to completely generate a software application from a System Descriptor
model.  Instead, it is used to generate infrastructure, boilerplate, or other "uninteresting" (and likely error-prone)
aspects of an application.  Application developers are still expected to implement the core business functionality of
the app themselves.  Jellyfish aims to generate unobtrusive code, so developers are free to implement their own
business logic however they wish.

# The Command Line Interface
Most users will directly interact with Jellyfish using its command line interface (CLI).  Users run the command
`jellyfish` from a prompt and supply the Jellyfish action or command to execute along with any arguments needed to
perform that action.

The simplest command is the `validate` command.  This command can be used to check the syntax of an SD project.  It
can be run like this:

**jellyfish CLI example**
```
$> jellyfish validate inputDirectory=/home/me/my-sd-project
System Descriptor project is valid.
-- SUCCESS (00:00:03.173) --
```

The `inputDirectory` parameter is used to point to the specific location of the project on disk.

## Help
Users can always run `jellyfish help` to learn about the available commands and parameters needed to run a particular
Jellyfish command.

**Viewing help**
```
$> jellyfish help
Usage: jellyfish <command-name> [parameter1=value1 ...]
Jellyfish is a command-line tool for inspecting System Descriptor projects and generating various custom artifacts
from a project. Most commands require you to identify the System Descriptor project, either using the parameter
`gav=<groupId>:<artifactId>:version` or `inputDirectory=<path-to-project>`.

Commands:

   analyze                                Runs various types of analysis and generates reports
   analyze-budget                         Analyzes the budgets of a model and its parts. This command is rarely ran
                                          directly; instead it is run with the 'analyze' command.
   analyze-features                       Checks that scenarios have a corresponding feature file and vice versa.
                                          This command is rarely ran directly; instead it is run with the 'analyze'
                                          command.
   analyze-inputs-outputs                 Checks that models which have inputs also have outputs
   console-report                         Outputs the results of analysis to the console.  This command is rarely
                                          ran directly; instead it is run with the 'analyze' command.
...
```

Users can also see help for a specific command.  For example, this shows help for the `analyze` command:

**Viewing help for a particular command**
```
$> jellyfish help command=analyze

# Jellyfish Setup
Users can download the latest version of Jellyfish at
[https://github.ms.northgrum.com/CEACIDE/jellyfish/releases](https://github.ms.northgrum.com/CEACIDE/jellyfish/releases)
.

1.  Download the file named jellyfish-X.X.X.zip listed under assets.  Replace _X.X.X_ with the latest version of
Jellyfish.
1. Extract the ZIP file to any location.
1. In order to be able to run Jellyfish from any command prompt, it is necessary to add the location where Jellyfish
was unzipped to the system's `PATH`.  This process is different for Windows and Linux users.
    1. **Windows**: Search for `env` and select **Edit Environment Variables for your account**.
        1. Select the `PATH` variable and select **Edit**.
        1. Add the following to the field: `;<JELLYFISH_DIRECTORY>\bin` where `<JELLYFISH_DIRECTORY>` is the directory
        where the Jellyfish ZIP was extracted.
        1. Click OK to save the changes.
    1. **Linux**: Edit the profile file of the user's preferred shell, for example `~/.bashrc`.
        1. Add the line `export PATH=<JELLYFISH_DIRECTORY>/bin:$PATH` where `<JELLYFISH_DIRECTORY>` is the directory
        where the Jellyfish ZIP was extracted.
    1.  In either case, open a new command prompt or terminal and run `jellyfish help` to verify everything is working
    correctly.

## Configuring Jellyfish to Download Projects from a Remote Repository
Many Jellyfish commands allow the user to specify an SD project that is stored remotely.  In this case, Jellyfish
will automatically download the project if necessary.  This is useful when releasing and uploading SD projects to a
remote repository such as Nexus.  This requires the configuration of the URL that identifies the location of the
remote repository.  Since the Gradle build tool also needs this information, Jellyfish is configured to use the same
settings as Gradle.

To configure the location of the remote repository, do the following:
1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the directory given by the environment variable `$GRADLE_USER_HOME`.  If
this variable is not set, a default value of `~/.gradle` is assumed.  On Windows, the default location is
`C:\Users\$USER\.gradle`.
1. Create a new property named `nexusConsolidated`.  Set the value of the property to the URL of the remote repository.

Below is an example from a file that is stored at the location `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

**gradle.properties**
```
nexusConsolidated=https://nexusrepomgr.ms.northgrum.com/repository/my-project
```

## Gradle Setup
Jellyfish generates projects that use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as their build tool.  SD projects will also use Gradle.
Luckily, Gradle includes a feature called the [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/4.9/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
which allows Gradle to automatically install itself.  Jellyfish uses the wrapper when generating projects which means
users won't have to install Gradle before running Jellyfish.

**However**, users will still want to setup a `gradle.properties` files.  As described in
**Configuring Jellyfish to Download Projects from a Remote Repository**, this file should be located at
`$GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties`.  The default Windows location is `C:\Users\$USER\.gradle\gradle.properties` and
the default Linux location is `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.  This file needs to contain the following properties:

* `nexusConsolidated`: This is the location of the remote Maven repository from which to download dependencies.  This is
  usually something like Nexus or JFrog.  A good default value for a NG connected machine is
  `https://nexusrepomgr.ms.northgrum.com/repository/maven-ng-proxy/`.
* `nexusSnapshots`: This is the location of the remote Maven repository to which snapshots should be uploaded.  Snapshots
  are artifacts that have not been officially released yet but you want to able able to share these artifacts with others.
  Snapshots are usually used to preview changes.  **If you don't plan on uploading snapshots, set this property to any
  value you want.**
* `nexusReleases`: This is the location of the remote Maven repository to which releases should be uploaded.  Releases are
  officially published artifacts.  You release projects so others can use them.  **If you don't plan on uploading
  releases, set this property to any value you want.**
* `nexusUsername`: This is the username for the remote Maven repository used when uploading either snapshots or
  releases. Most remote repositories require authentication before something can be uploaded to it.  **If you don't
  plan on uploading or don't have a username, leave this value blank or set it to anything you want.**
* `nexusPassword`: This is the password for the remote Maven repository used when uploading either snapshots or
  releases. Most remote repositories require authentication before something can be uploaded to it.  **If you don't
  plan on uploading or don't have a password, leave this value blank or set it to anything you want.**

Below is an example of a `gradle.properties` file that is a good starting point:

**gradle.properties**
```
nexusReleases=https://nexusrepomgr.ms.northgrum.com/repository/maven-ng-releases/
nexusSnapshots=https://nexusrepomgr.ms.northgrum.com/repository/maven-ng-snapshots/
nexusConsolidated=https://nexusrepomgr.ms.northgrum.com/repository/maven-ng-proxy/

# It's okay to leave this value blank.
nexusUsername=<my-nexus-username>
# It's okay to leave this value blank.
nexusPassword=<my-nexus-password>
```

**Gradle wrapper only works in an online environment**
```note-warning
The Gradle wrapper configuration that Jellyfish generates will only function if the host machine that contains the
generated project can reach internal Northrup sites.  If not, users will need to install Gradle manually and avoid
using the wrapper.

Alternately, users can host their own Gradle distributions and configure Gradle to use that location to download Gradle.
```

# Additional Features
Jellyfish also provides additional features including
* The ability to create and run custom analyses of SD projects.  Teams can use this functionality to generate custom
artifacts directly from the model.
* A Sonarqube plugin which integrates Jellyfish with Sonarqube.  This makes it possible to employ automated quality
assessments of SD projects in the same way that quality assessments of software/code projects are performed.
In particular, teams can build custom analyses that detect undesirable architectural patterns in SD projects.  Teams
can then configure the SD projects so that the results of these analyses are posted to Sonarqube automatically and
teams can review architectural trends of projects.
* Various Gradle plugins to make it possible to perform Jellyfish actions during a Gradle build.  This is useful for
both SD projects and software code projects that are generated from an SD project.

All of these features are covered throughout this book.
