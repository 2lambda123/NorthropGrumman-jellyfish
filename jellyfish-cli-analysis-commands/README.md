# jellyfish-cli-analysis-commands
This project contains Jellyfish commands that can be used to perform various analysis and generate reports from a 
System Descriptor project.  Analysis can be executed and reports generated by running the `analyze` command.  For
example, the following command runs the `analyze-inputs-outputs`, generates an HTML report of the results, and 
displays the results to the console:
```
jellyfish analyze \
 analyses=analyze-inputs-outputs \
 reports=html-report,console-report \
 reportName=analysis-results \
 outputDirectory=output/results
 gav=my.group:my.sd.project:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
```

You can also use the `inputDirectory` parameter instead of `gav` to scan a project directly.

# Analysis
Various types of analysis can be executed.

## analyze-inputs-outputs 
This analysis checks that models have at least one output.  See
[Ch. 1 Avoid components that have inputs but no outputs](http://10.166.134.55/confluence/display/SEAS/Ch.+1+Avoid+components+that+have+inputs+but+no+outputs)
for details

# Reports
Jellyfish can also generate various reports which contain the results of the analysis.

## html-report
Generates an HTML report.  Use the parameters `reportName` and `outputDirectory` to control the name of the report and
the directory where the report will be created.

## console-report
Outputs the results of analysis directly to the console as markdown.
