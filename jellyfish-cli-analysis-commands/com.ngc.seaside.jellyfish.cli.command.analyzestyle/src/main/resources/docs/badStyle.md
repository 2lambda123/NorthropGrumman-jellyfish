## Names of System Descriptor elements should follow standard conventions
Teams and programs should establish consistent naming convention for elements of System Descriptors
such as package names, model and data names, or field names.

The default conventions are:

* Package names - lower case letters and numbers separated by periods; e.g., `com.example.packagename`
* Model, Data, and Enumeration names - upper camel case; e.g., `ExampleModelName`
* Field and scenario names - lower camel case; e.g., `exampleFieldName`
* Enumeration values - upper case letters and numbers separated by underscores; e.g., `ENUMERATION_FIELD_EXAMPLE`

These default conventions may not be applicable if your team or program has established a different convention.
